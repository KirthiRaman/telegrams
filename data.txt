9 To be or not to be that is the question
7 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
9 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
11 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
8 And by opposing end them To die to sleep
5 No more and by a sleep to say we end
15 The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
15 That flesh is heir to 'tis a consummation
8 Devoutly to be wish'd To die to sleep
10 To sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub
6 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
10 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
7 Must give us pause there's the respect
11 That makes calamity of so long life
12 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
13 The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
9 The pangs of despised love, the law's delay
10 The insolence of office and the spurns
10 That patient merit of the unworthy takes
11 When he himself might his quietus make
10 With a bare bodkin who would fardels bear
5 To grunt and sweat under a weary life
12 But that the dread of something after death
15 The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
12 No traveller returns, puzzles the will
15 And makes us rather bear those ills we have
13 Than fly to others that we know not of
11 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
11 And thus the native hue of resolution
12 Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought
14 And enterprises of great pith and moment
8 With this regard their currents turn awry
100 And lose the name of action Soft you now
100 The fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisons
100 Be all my sins remember'd
